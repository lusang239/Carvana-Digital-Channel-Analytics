    "# Analyst Technical Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your technical assessment for the Analyst position at Carvana. This is an opportunity for us to understand your technical proficiency in Python and your ability to analyze and interpret complex marketing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this assessment is to analyze our marketing data, specifically focusing on user click data and subsequent user actions leading up to sales. Each click event is associated with a specific marketing channel, and your task is to attribute user actions to these channels. Your analysis should help us understand the relative performance for each channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we do heavily utilize ChatGPT and other LLM tools, we ask that you do not use these tools when completing these exercise. Additionally, while you don’t need to prepare a formal presentation for now, we would ask in a final interview for you to present a few slides about your analysis during a final in-person interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please reach out to Chris Henk (chris.henk@carvana.com) or Jaron Hom (jaron.hom@carvana.com)if you encounter any technical difficulties with this exercise, or have any questions/need clarification about the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "You will be working with six datasets provided in CSV format in the data folder that will be preloaded in the starter code. These datasets encompass various aspects of our marketing data. A brief description of each dataset is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Click Data:** This dataset contains all click events that lead users to Carvana.com from various paid marketing channels.\n",
    "- click_datetime\n",
    "- channel_id\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "  \n",
    "Once customers land on the site, they may find a vehicle they are interested in purchasing. When the customer initiates the purchase, this is called a \"lock\" as the vehicle has been locked (i.e., a different customer will not be able to start the purchase process on that same vehicle) until the customer either completes the purchase or backs out. Not every lock will convert to a completed sale.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**2. Lock Data:**  This dataset contains all locks done by users:\n",
    "- lock_id\n",
    "- lock_datetime\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sale Data:** This dataset contains all sales:\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "- lock_id\n",
    "- sale_datetime\n",
    "- sale_id\n",
    "- make\n",
    "- model\n",
    "- has_trade_in\n",
    "- is_financed\n",
    "- apr\n",
    "- delivery_distance\n",
    "\n",
    "**4: Spend Data:** This dataset contains daily marketing spend:\n",
    "- date\n",
    "- channel_id\n",
    "- spend\n",
    "\n",
    "**5: Ad Channels:** This dataset contains all information for each marketing channel:\n",
    "- channel_id\n",
    "- channel_name\n",
    "\n",
    "**6: Vehicles:** This dataset contains information on average profit for vehicle make models:\n",
    "- make\n",
    "- model\n",
    "- bodystyle\n",
    "- avg_margin\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For the ad channels, the channel_name is in the format of **category-partner_campaign** for the marketing channel. Some channels have separate campaigns within them and some don't. Treat the partnership as its own campaign if it doesn't have one. While we’ve provided dummy names in these datasets, the categories, partners, and campaigns mimic real-life examples (e.g., an advertising category could be social or search, a nadvertising partner could be Google or Disney, and a campaign could be split into different age groups or other customer segments). **You will need to parse these out for the following questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "We are interested in understanding the relative performance of each marketing channel in 2022 to inform our course of action for the next year. To do so, we need to understand the economics of each channel, with metrics such as Cost total Per Click (CPC = advertising spend divided by total clicks), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC = advertising spend divided by number of sales), and Return on Investment (ROI = gross profit divided by advertising spend). \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we want to know if there are any partnerships or even individual campaigns which are under or over performing so that we can act appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: You will perform this analysis using **first-touch attribution**, which in marketing terms means identifying the first interaction a user has with our brand and linking it to any later user actions. This involves manipulating the provided datasets to locate the first click each user made through our marketing channels and associating it with any subsequent locks and sales (e.g., a customer who first clicked a KnickKnack ad, then a DatAnkle ad would be fully attributed to the KnicKnack channel, with zero credit given to DatAnkle). This will help identify which channels are most effective at initiating customer journeys that result in sales."

    "### **(IMPORTANT)** Calculating Profit\n",
    "\n",
    "The profit we earn from each sale is calculated based on a set of rules that consider various factors such as the make/model of the vehicle sold, the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) the customer financed with, the delivery distance of the vehicle, and whether or not there was a trade-in. Follow the rules below to calculate the value of each sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Starting Value\n",
    "The starting value for each calculation is the average margin of the make/model within the given dataset (avg_margin column in vehicles.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### APR Modifier\n",
    "Next, determine a modifier by calculating the percent difference of the APR of each sale to the average APR of the month, which is calculated exclusively using financed sales, i.e., only include sales with APR in the calculation. If the sale is not financed, then simply use a modifier of -0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conditional modifier is then multiplied with the starting value (average gross profit for the make and model sold). For example, if a sale has an APR of 15% and the monthly average for financed sales in the same month is 12%. Then, the modifier calculation will be *(0.15 - 0.12)/0.12*.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Calculate the Modified Starting Value\n",
    "The modifier is meant to increase or decrease the starting value. Apply it using the following formula: **[Starting Value] * (1 + [APR Modifier])**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bodystyle Considerations\n",
    "Finally, the vehicle's bodystyle will affect the final calculation as the amount that we value a trade-in is different for each and shipping costs can vary based on the size and weight of vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the vehicle sold is a Sedan or Hatchback\n",
    "    - increase the modified value by 200\n",
    "    - reduce it by half the delivery distance\n",
    "    - If there's a trade-in, add another 400\n",
    "- If the vehicle sold is a Coupe or SUV\n",
    "    - subtract 0.8 times the delivery distance from the modified value\n",
    "    - If there's a trade-in, add another 300\n",
    "- If the vehicle sold is a Truck\n",
    "    - reduce the modified value by 200\n",
    "    - subtract the full delivery distance\n",
    "    - If there's a trade-in, a further 200 will be added\n",
    " \n",
    "**The value that you calculate here is the profit for that sale and should be used in ROI calculations**"
